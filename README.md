## Hi, I'm Jaco 👋

I'm a final-year Software Engineering student passionate about building full-stack applications that solve real problems and improve efficiency.

## 🚧 Current Projects

I'm currently working on two full-stack projects:
- A **web-based inventory management application** for small to medium-sized businesses, featuring stock tracking,
low-stock alerts, and sales visualization through a custom admin dashboard.
- A **mobile social networking app** using Flutter and Supabase, focused on interest-based discovery, in-app messaging,
geolocation filtering, and user safety features like profile verification and reporting.
